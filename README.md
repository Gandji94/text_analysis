# text_analysis

Nowadays, it is widespread to rate a product, usually 1 to 5 stars, and comment on it. But what will provide more insight, the (star) rating or the comments?
A text analysis is a valuable tool that will provide a quick statement/score if the comment is positive or negative. Text analyses will allow us to look past the (star) rating and give us a deeper insight/understanding of what the customers think about the service/product.
In my following project, I analyzed a data set about how customers rated and commented on socks they purchased. I used the Vader and Flair libraries in Python to perform the analysis.
